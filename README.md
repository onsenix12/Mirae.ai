# SCOPE+
**Dashboard-Based, Multi-Stage, AI-Powered Career Exploration Platform**

---

## Overview

SCOPE+ is a dashboard-based career exploration platform that guides Korean high school students through 6 progressive stages—from initial self-understanding to final course selections. Each stage combines interactive activities (swipe mechanics, drag-drop, tournaments) with chatbot-guided reflection to build toward concrete course recommendations.

**Core Innovation:** Gamified exploration + AI synthesis → Data-driven course roadmap
