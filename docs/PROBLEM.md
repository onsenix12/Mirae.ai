# PROBLEM.MD 

## The Problem in One Sentence

**Korean high school students must commit to early course selection paths that effectively shape academic direction by Year 1, then live with that decision through Year 3—but have no safe way to explore, question, or reconsider whether their path actually fits them.**

---

## Who Has This Problem

**Primary Users:**  
Korean high school students (ages 15-18) in the new High School Credit System (2025+)

**Specific Pain Points by Year:**

**Year 1 (March-April):**
- Must choose CSAT-related course paths without context or exploration
- Fear making "wrong" decisions that are technically reversible but practically costly
- Pressure to commit before understanding options

**Year 2:**
- Realizing initial choice may not fit
- Experiencing doubt but afraid to switch
- Seeing peers in other paths, wondering "what if?"
- Feeling stuck due to prerequisite gaps

**Year 3:**
- Facing CSAT preparation misaligned with earlier choices
- Too late to change but full of regret
- Going through motions without conviction

**All Years:**
- Cannot safely question or explore alternatives
- Living with uncertainty but unable to process it
- Making decisions based on fear, not fit

---

## Why Now

### New System, Old Pressure, Ongoing Doubt

**Starting 2025**, the High School Credit System promises flexibility:
- Students can choose courses based on interests
- Multiple pathways and recovery mechanisms exist
- System designed for personalized learning

**BUT the structure changed faster than guidance and support systems:**
- CSAT is largely standardized with common subjects for all students
- However, CSAT readiness depends heavily on prior course choices
- Early coursework decisions create path dependency, even without formal tracks

**The Gap Across All Years:**

| Year | What Students Face | Support Available |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Year 1 | Must choose course paths by April | Brief counseling (1:400 ratio) |
| Year 2 | Doubting choice, considering switch | Same overloaded counselors |
| Year 3 | Locked into CSAT preparation | Too late to change |

> "Students may feel even more pressure now — not only do we have to earn credits, but we also have to carefully plan our high school 'course strategy.'" ¹

**Critical Timing:** The first cohort under the new High School Credit System will graduate in 2028. We're building for the anxious early adopters who are navigating uncharted territory—more flexibility on paper, but no reduction in psychological pressure.

**The result:** Students make early commitments and live with doubt for 3 years, with no structured support for honest reflection.

## The Core Problem

### Students Cannot Safely Question Their Path—Ever

**The problem isn't just "choosing wrong"—it's having no safe space to think honestly at ANY decision point.**

#### What's Broken:

**1. Cultural Judgment Makes Questioning Unsafe**
- Changing your mind = admitting failure
- Expressing doubt = weakness or lack of direction
- Only "safe" answer is certainty (even if false)
- Students must maintain appearance of conviction

> "Anxiety about the future, pressure from family, fear of disappointing parents, and low self-confidence are key factors." ²

**2. Multiple Decision Points, Zero Support**

**Year 1:** Choose course paths without exploration
- **28.2%** cite "lack of relevant guidance" ⁵
- Must "write career and study plan" before having context ³

**Year 2:** Realize misalignment but afraid to switch
- Switching means admitting Year 1 was "wrong"
- Prerequisite gaps make switching costly
- No support for reconsidering path

**Year 3:** Locked into CSAT preparation
- Too invested to change
- Must perform conviction even with regret
- "Should have known earlier" but never had chance to explore

**3. Existing "Solutions" Don't Address This**
- **Counselors (1:400 ratio):** Handle logistics, not ongoing doubt ⁴
- **Career platforms:** Evaluative, not exploratory
- **Parents/Hagwon:** Push certainty and prestige
- **Peers:** Competition prevents honest sharing

**No one provides:** Safe space to question, reconsider, or explore alternatives throughout the journey.

## Competitive Landscape Analysis

### What Currently Exists

| Solution | What It Does | Why It Doesn't Solve This Problem |
|----------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| **CareerNet (커리어넷)** | Government platform: career tests, job/school info, counseling requests | **Evaluative** (tests you and gives results), **visible** (linked to school records), focuses on career info not path doubt processing |
| **상냥이 (Sangnyang.ai)** | AI chatbot for youth mental health & career support | Focuses on **emotional wellbeing broadly**, not specifically STEM/Humanities track doubt; marketed to schools so **not perceived as private** |
| **Orbi (오르비)** | Student community forum for CSAT discussion | **Public** (peers see posts), **competitive** environment, advice-giving culture not safe exploration |
| **Hagwon Counseling** | Private academies offer college guidance | **Biased toward prestige paths**, parents often involved, expensive (~$445/month), **not psychologically safe** |
| **AI Helpy (Elice)** | Education ministry-certified AI chatbot | **Learning-focused** (helps with coursework), not designed for exploratory counseling |
| **US Career Chatbots** (Coach, Making Waves) | Career guidance chatbots | Built for US college context, **transactional** (answer questions), not designed for processing doubt over time |

### The Positioning Gap

**None of these provide:**
- A **private**, non-judgmental space
- Specifically for processing **path uncertainty** (STEM vs Humanities)
- That supports students **throughout** high school (not one-time assessment)
- Through **exploration** (not evaluation or advice-giving)

**Existing solutions are:**
- **Evaluative:** They test you and give you a result
- **Visible:** Tied to school systems, counselors, or parents
- **Transactional:** Answer questions, don't help you think
- **One-time:** Assessment at a point in time, not ongoing support

**Our differentiation:** Safe, ongoing exploration of path uncertainty—not assessment, not advice, not visible.

## The Pain

### Immediate (Every Year):
- **Year 1:** Stress, confusion, fear during initial choice
- **Year 2:** Silent doubt, comparison with others, regret
- **Year 3:** Going through motions, "what if" thoughts
- **All years:** Loneliness, inability to process uncertainty

### Long-term Cost:
- Years in misaligned major/career path
- Cannot easily switch after CSAT commitment
- Accumulated regret and "sunken cost" thinking
- **Mental health crisis:**
  - 6.9% report suicidal ideation
  - Academic/career stress = #1 reason
  - Korea has highest youth suicide rate among OECD ⁶

### System Cost:
- Credit system's flexibility fails in practice
- Students choose for **"scoring advantages rather than academic curiosity"** ⁷
- Inequality widens (wealthy families pay $445/month for private guidance) ⁸
- Lost potential from misalignment

---

## What Currently Happens

### Year 1 (March-April):
1. Attend subject briefing sessions
2. Brief counseling (if available)
3. Consult parents/hagwon
4. **Default to "safe" prestige path**

### Year 2-3:
1. Experience doubt privately
2. Ask friends "are you sure about your choice?"
3. Google "can I switch from humanities to STEM?"
4. Browse Orbi forums late at night
5. **Stay silent, continue on chosen path**

### What Students DON'T Do (Any Year):
- Explore alternatives without judgment
- Test whether current path actually fits
- Reconsider decisions openly
- Process uncertainty with support
- Feel ownership over changes

**The Result:**
> Students make early decisions based on fear, then live with unprocessed doubt for years, unable to explore or reconsider because questioning feels like failure.

---

## Summary

Korean students face path uncertainty throughout high school—from initial choice (Year 1) through doubt (Year 2) to regret (Year 3)—but have no safe way to explore or reconsider at any point. 

The new credit system increased flexibility but didn't reduce psychological pressure. Existing solutions (CareerNet, hagwon counseling, peer forums) are either evaluative, visible, or transactional—none provide safe, ongoing exploration space.

Students need space to think honestly about their path not just once, but continuously as they learn more about themselves.

**The gap:** Between having structural flexibility and feeling psychologically safe enough to use it.
