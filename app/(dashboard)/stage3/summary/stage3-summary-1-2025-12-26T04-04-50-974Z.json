I’m actually really enjoying my English course but I’m having a hard time keeping up with my Math. \nMirae: It’s great to hear that you're enjoying English! Math can be challenging for many students, so you're not alone. Have you thought about reaching out for extra help, like asking your teacher or joining a study group? It could really make a difference! What specific areas in Math are you finding tough?\nStudent: Hmm I'll try to make a study group. Algebra is fine, but I'm struggling with Calculus.\nMirae: Starting a study group sounds like a fantastic idea! Calculus can be tricky, but working with peers can really help clarify things. You might also consider finding online resources or video tutorials that explain concepts in a different way. What topics in Calculus do you find the most challenging right now?",
